# Fake_News_Detection

Fake news detection is an important classification problem in machine learning community. Not only that, there is a huge demand to curb the spread of fake news in recent years. In this article, we present the implementation of fake news detection with multiple ML models. Note that, this article gives a very simple picture of fake news detection for beginners and hence no way comparable to top-notch models.

Here we have used CountVectorizer to extract features from text and performed additional pre-processing like removal of stopwords, lemmatization, bigram generation etc. Then multiple ML models were utilised to check for the accuracy in detection of fake news using the features extracted.
